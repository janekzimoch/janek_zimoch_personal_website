My name is Janek Zimoch, I am curently working as a research intern in Computer Vision Group at Toshiba Research Laboratory in Cambridge, UK. Prior to that, I graduated with commendation (Top 3-5) from an MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence [(MLMI)](https://www.mlmi.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge. I interested in Software Engineering and Machine Learning in 2018, when during my exchange year at the University of Taxas at Austin I took several Software courses and started 'Extended Vision' computer vision project. In 2019 I came back to the UK to finish my Mechanical Engineering undergaduate degree at University of Bristol (Top 1-2), while continuing my new interest in Software development and Machine Learning.

My overarching goal is to build innovative software products to be used by a wider public. My current technical strengths lie in 
Three main personal trats which will help me along this quest are my: curiosity, proactiveness, and work ethic.
