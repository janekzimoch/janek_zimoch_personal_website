My name is Janek Zimoch, I am a computer vision research intern at Toshiba Research Laboratory in Cambridge, UK. I graduated with commendation (Top 3-5) from an MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence [(MLMI)](https://www.mlmi.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, in 2021. Prior to that I obtained first class honors in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Bristol, ranking Top 1-2 in cohort of 150 students. 

My interest in Software Engineering and Machine Learning began in summer 2018, when during my exchange year at UT Austin (TX, USA) I took several coding classes and started 'Extended Vision' computer vision project. My overarching goal is to build innovative software products to be used by a wider public.
