After copleting my thesis, I was invited to give a talk for Computer Vision Reading group at University of Cambridge led by prof. Roberto cipolla. After succesful reception, I gave the same talk also for the Toshiba's Computer Vision Group.

The talk presents novelty of my research. How we can perform multimodal scene re-localisation using probabilistic methods.
