TechStars Startup Weekend is an educational event which brings together professionals from: technical, business, and design backgrounds to build new startups, from scratch, in just 3 days. Together with 4 of my friends (Vlad, Charis, Odyseas, and James) we organised this event in Bristol, for the first time. We gathered together 60+ driven professionals from South-West England to offer them an opportunity to share their ideas, collaborate, and to create something new. 

To provide best environment possible we organised an amazing venue, delcious food, and an array of experienced startup and VC veterans as mentors. The preparation for the event took us 3 months and my responsibilities included: event marketing, sale of tickets, finding and sourcing best catering deal, as well as smaller logistical tasks. The event was a great success with some teams continuing work on thier startups for many months after the event! 


Here is an after-video i put together, have a look! :smiley:
